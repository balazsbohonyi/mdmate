# Phase 0 decisions

Deviations from the plan and choices it left open. Numbers carry the OS they came from.

## P0-T1

- **TypeScript stays on `~6.0.3`, not 7.x.** typescript-eslint 8 requires `<6.1.0`, so 7.x would break the lint gate. Revisit when typescript-eslint supports it.
- **Removed the Google Fonts import shadcn-vue added to `tokens.css`, and the `font` key in `components.json`.** It is a network request, which ISC-20 forbids. `--font-sans` is a system stack.
- **Added `src/lib/` to the layout.** shadcn-vue's `cn` helper lives there.
- **`tauri.conf.json` `backgroundColor` duplicates the dark `--background` token (`#1e1f22`).** The native window paints before any CSS loads, so the value cannot come from a token at runtime. A comment in `tokens.css` names the pair.
- **`tauri-plugin-opener` left out of the scaffold.** Nothing uses it before Phase 5, which adds it with the link guard.
- **The crate builds as `rlib` only.** The template's `staticlib` and `cdylib` exist for mobile, which is out of scope, and they slow builds.
- **`ai-docs/standards/vue.md` does not exist,** though `AGENTS.md` routes `.vue` work to it. No standard was invented; Vue linting follows `typescript.md`. Writing it is the owner's call.
- **ISC-169 closes in P0-T3, not P0-T1.** `LICENSE` is added here, but the claim's probe is `check-arch.mjs license-mit`, which T3 builds.
